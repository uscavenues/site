          Staff photographers may have resized images shot from a master drawing
          — or a print from a trial size of the type — for punchcutters to
          engrave onto their punches/patrices, whey they could follow as a
          guide. The then still-larger Schelter & Giesecke foundry at Leipzig
          had been using pantographs to scale letter drawings down to type size
          by 1894, for instance, and could even trace outlines onto the faces of
          punches and patrices this way. While Schattierte Grotesk and
          Akzidenz-Grotesk really were new designs when they were published,
          they were not atypical products. Many of their letterforms bear
          resemblance to earlier sans serifs that had already been published in
          and outside of Germany. Nevertheless, they seem to me to be more of a
          synthesis of then-current ideas of sans serif letterform design,
          rather than copies of any specific products from other firms. The name
          Akzidenz-Grotesk means jobbing sans. It came from the German-language
          term for everyday commercial printing, Akzidenzen. This was a loan
          word, rooted in the Latin accidentia, which referred to chance or
          casual events. Jobbing encompassed things like business cards,
          invoices, and letterheads. Berthold/Bauer & Co. must have intended for
          Akzidenz-Grotesk to be used in jobbing typography from the first.
          Together, their circa 1904 and circa 1912 specimen brochures for the
          typeface and its later — or otherwise related — styles included
          twenty-six pages of

          fictitious fonts in use scenarios. These ranged from advertisements
          for art galleries, interior decorators, and piano-making companies to
          engagement and change of address cards, as well as price lists for a
          baby carriage manufacturer and a vintner. The large Berthold/Bauer &
          Co. catalogue from circa 1911 included the same kind of fictitious
          usage scenarios for these fonts as well. Accidenz-Grotesk specimen,
          Bauer & Co. and Berthold (circa 1911). The first proper addition to
          Akzidenz-Grotesk was published by Berthold and Bauer & Co. in 1902/03.
          This was a lighter-weight design that was initially sold under a
          unique name: Royal-Grotesk. We know that Akzidenz-Grotesk and
          Royal-Grotesk were intended to be used together — is that not the
          basic definition of what a typeface family is? — because Berthold and
          Bauer & Co. produced a dedicated specimen brochure for the two faces
          about a year after Royal-Grotesk’s release. It was not until the 1950s
          that Royal-Grotesk would be properly adopted into the family, and
          renamed Akzidenz-Grotesk Light. Since 1998, many authors have
          incorrectly stated that Royal-Grotesk predated Akzidenz-Grotesk, and
          that it had been designed by the Berlin-based punchcutter and
          typefoundry owner Ferdinand Theinhardt. Indeed, Theinhardt’s foundry
          was acquired by Berthold in 1908. Berthold kept it open in its own

          and almost implies that Akzidenz-Grotesk is the default variety of
          sans serif type. I think that this was a brilliant marketing move, but
          I have not yet been able to find out whether this was a decision made
          at Berthold, Tetterode, or Amsterdam Continental. Enge
          Accidenz-Grotesk, Enge Steinschrift, Accidenz-Grotesk specimen, Bauer

          Accidenz-Grotesk specimen, Bauer & Co. and Berthold (circa 1911). A
          list inside a small book published by Berthold for their 1958
          centenary suggests that oldest weights of the Akzidenz-Grotesk family
          were from 1896. These were not even named Akzidenz-Grotesk when they
          were initially published. They were renamed Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed
          Heavy and Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed Bold, from Enge Steinschrift and
          Halbfette Bücher-Grotesk. Those generic terms meant narrow stone type
          and bold book sans, despite the latter not being a typeface with which
          anyone would compose a book. The stone referenced in the former’s name
          was likely the lithographer’s stone. Like Akzidenz-Grotesk itself,
          those types cannot be attributed to a specific designer or
          punchcutter. Despite the year 1896 given in the centenary publication,
          Enge Steinschrift and Halbfette Bücher-Grotesk may not be from 1896,
          exactly. Enge Steinschrift is older than that, and Halbfette

          decades before this. He sold off his foundry in the mid 1880s, and
          died in 1906. The misattribution of Akzidenz-Grotesk and Royal-Grotesk
          to Theinhardt was put forward by Günter Gerhard Lange between 1998 and
          2002. Lange was Berthold’s longtime artistic director and the designer
          of several later versions of Akzidenz-Grotesk. His claims about

          typefaces designed in the style of Akzidenz-Grotesk, which are

          Ferdinand Theinhardt did not cut the punches for Royal-Grotesk or
          Akzidenz-Grotesk — he might not have even ever cut sans serif type at
          all. The only collection of type specimen from his foundry I have
          found that can definitively be dated to the time when he still owned
          the company includes just two sans serifs. Ferdinand Theinhardt gave
          this folio to the German printer and author Theodor Goebel in January
          1884, about a year before he sold his business. The first of the
          folio’s two sans serifs was simply called Grotesque. This was a
